### Software Details

- These scripts can integrate the ISC-KEA DHCP server with Zabbix for monitoring, specifically the percentage of free IPs by VLAN, with the goal of understanding usage and improving availability to mitigate issues in IP distribution.

- The commands use `socat` to get access to the ISC-KEA API and the scripts are written in Python for easy readability and customization.
